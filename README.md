**Abstract:** Ocean deoxygenation, warming, and acidification resulting from global change and increasing nutrient inputs are major threats to marine ecosystems. Despite this, spatial and temporal patterns of oxygen availability and their impacts on marine life are nuderstudied compared to warming and acidification, particularly in coastal tropical ecosystems. We measured the abundance of major groups of zooplankton in the context of five covarying environmental parameters (temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen (DO), dissolved organic matter (DOM), and chlorophyll concentration) in a tropical estuary for one year. Partial least squares showed that environmental conditions explained 20% of the variation in the community and found that temperature, salinity, DO, and DOM were most important (VIP > 0.8). A generalized linear model identified depth, DO, salinity, and chlorophyll as significant main effects, as well as two-way interactions with temperature and DOM (_p_ < 0.05). When examined separately, the abundance of each zooplankton group was explained by a slightly different combination of environmental factors, but in all cases DO had large, significant effects, and in most cases DOM or its interactions were also significant. These results demonstrate that the seasonal cycle of hypoxia in this system significantly impacts the abundance of major zooplankton groups, and likely also recruitment of benthic fauna through impacts on meroplankton and benthic-pelagic food webs.
